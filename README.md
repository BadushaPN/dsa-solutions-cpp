# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, implemented in **C++**.  
It is meant for **practice, interview preparation, and problem-solving consistency**.

---

## 📂 Structure
- Each topic is organized into folders.
- Solutions are written in clean, beginner-friendly C++.
- Problem statements (where needed) are added as comments.

---

## 📘 Topics (Work in Progress)
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked List
- Stack & Queue
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Binary Trees & BST
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

---

## 🚀 Purpose
- Build a strong foundation in DSA using C++
- Sharpen problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews & competitive programming

---

## ⚡ Future Updates
- Add time and space complexity analysis
- Add multiple approaches (brute force vs optimized)
- LeetCode / Codeforces / GFG practice problems

---

## 🛠️ Language & Tools
- **C++ (C++17/20)**
- Compiled with `g++`

---

## 📅 Progress
This repository is **continuously updated** as I learn and solve more problems.
